Media captionIran 'put on notice', says White House

US President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor has accused the Iranian government of "malign actions" after a missile test.

Without elaborating, Michael Flynn told White House reporters: "As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice."

Washington earlier declared the test to be "absolutely unacceptable".

Iran confirmed on Wednesday it had tested a missile over the weekend, but denied violating a UN Security Council resolution.

Mr Flynn did not provide any further details of what actions the US may be planning in response to the test, which Pentagon officials say failed upon re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.

The launch prompted the US to accuse Iran of violating UN resolution 2231, which "calls upon" Iran not to "undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons".

As part of its final negotiations for the 2015 nuclear agreement with six world powers, Tehran agreed to an eight-year extension of the UN ban on ballistic missile development.

During the White House daily press briefing, Mr Flynn did not accuse Tehran of violating that nuclear accord.

But the national security adviser did describe the Obama administration-brokered deal as "weak and ineffective".

"Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened," he said.

He said "the Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions - including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms".

Mr Flynn also pointed to a recent attack against a Saudi warship by Iranian-backed Houthi militants as evidence of "Iran's destabilising behaviour across the Middle East".

During Mr Trump's campaign for president, he frequently attacked the nuclear pact with Iran, vowing to "dismantle the disastrous deal".

In December 2016 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told an audience at the University of Tehran that he would not allow Mr Trump to "rip up" the deal, Reuters news agency reported.

On Wednesday Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan stood by their missile test.

"We have previously announced that we will execute the programmes we have planned in production of defence equipment meant for our national interests and objectives," Iranian media quoted him as saying.

"Nobody can influence our decision. We will not allow foreigners to interfere in our defence affairs."

Two former cyber-security experts at Russia's FSB intelligence agency and another at a software firm have been charged with treason, a lawyer says.

Ex-FSB men Sergei Mikhailov and Dmitry Dokuchayev, and an executive at the anti-virus software firm Kaspersky, Ruslan Stoyanov, are accused of working for US interests.

Some reports suggested the arrests could be linked to claims of Russian hacking during the US election.

The Kremlin denied the claim.

    Can US election hack be traced to Russia?

The names of those charged were given by Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer acting for one of the men.

Russian media reports suggest Mr Mikhailov, who was formerly deputy head of the FSB's cyber-security department, was detained in dramatic style and led out of a meeting with a bag over his head.

As with all treason cases, details of these accusations have not been made public.

But the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says claims from anonymous sources continue to circulate around the Russian capital, including one that links the arrests to a Russian server-renting firm accused of involvement in the hacking of voting systems in two US states.

President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the arrests were not related to the hacking, which Russia denies involvement in.

Other claims suggest that the men had links to a hacking group known as Shaltai Boltai (Humpty Dumpty), best known for digging dirt on senior Russian political figures and making it public.

He said they had been "attacked in the heart of their community".

Mr Labadi also described the courage of one of the victims, Azzedine Soufiane, 57, who died trying to protect other worshippers as the gunman entered the mosque on Sunday during evening prayers.

"He was safe behind the column there and when he see that the attacker recharge his gun he ran quickly to immobilise him," said Mr Labadi.

"But the attacker was more quick and he go back and shot him directly in his body and he fell down here. Fell down here as a hero."

He pointed to a patch of blood on the floor.

"Without his intervention, we would have more martyrs."

Mr Soufiane ran a halal butcher shop in the suburb of Sainte-Foy, down the street from the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and has been described as an important member of the local Muslim community.

The six worshippers who died were immigrants who had moved to Quebec to seek a better life.

Johnny Depp's financial troubles are caused by a lavish $2m-a-month lifestyle, say the business managers he is suing for mismanaging his earnings.

They claim he spent more than $75m (£59.6m) on 14 homes and $3m (£2.4m) blasting author Hunter S Thompson's ashes out of a cannon.

The Management Group are countersuing Depp after the Pirates of the Caribbean actor sued them for $25m (£20m).

Depp, they claim, is "fully responsible for any financial turmoil" he faces.

"He has refused to live within his means, despite... repeated warnings about his financial condition," their countersuit claims.

Their legal action, obtained by the Deadline website, also accuses the actor of spending:

    $18m (£14.3m) on an 150 foot (45 metre) yacht
    $4m (£3.2m) on a failed record label
    $3m (£2.4m) to blast Hunter S Thompson's ashes out of a cannon
    $300,000 (£238,600) a month to maintain a staff of 40 people
    $200,000 (£159,000) a month on private planes
    $150,000 (£119,330) a month on round-the-clock security
    $30,000 (£23,800) a month on buying and importing wine

He also needed 12 storage facilities to house his collection of Hollywood memorabilia, they allege.

Last month, Depp claimed The Management Group owed him more than $25m.

His lawsuit also alleges the company failed to file his taxes on time, costing him $5.7m (£4.5m) in penalties.

Depp's latest legal tussle comes in the wake of his divorce to Amber Heard, which was finalised in January after months of wrangling.

The 53-year-old will be seen later this year as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge.
